A quick project I threw together with some vibe coding, courtesy of Gemini 2.5 pro experimental, in like an hour. This is actually for my Chinese exam, because we all know the programmer's way of dealing with an issue is not to actually deal with it, but to waste 5x time trying to automate it.

## Recommended IDE Setup

[VSCode](https://code.visualstudio.com/) + [Volar](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=Vue.volar) (and disable Vetur).

But you know, I just use [neovim](https://github.com/yadobler/nixvim-config) MUAHAHAHHAHAAHHAHAHA (click for my config).

## Type Support for `.vue` Imports in TS

TypeScript cannot handle type information for `.vue` imports by default, so we replace the `tsc` CLI with `vue-tsc` for type checking. In editors, we need [Volar](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=Vue.volar) to make the TypeScript language service aware of `.vue` types.

## Customize configuration

See [Vite Configuration Reference](https://vite.dev/config/).
